TITLE:
Library-Management-Application

ABOUT:
In this application my group and I have utilized Python and its Tkinter module alongside MySQL for Database operations and connectivity.
We have also added validation for almost every functionality of our application.
On our application the user can first register for the library and then login using a username and password.

Then the user can perform multiple operations such as:-
  1.	Add books
  2.	Delete Books
  3.	View Books
  4.	Issue Books
  5.	Return Books
  6.	Add student
